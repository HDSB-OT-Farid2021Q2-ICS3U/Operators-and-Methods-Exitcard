# Operators and Functions/String Methods Exit Card

This exit card is to be completed at the end of the practice lesson once operators, built-in functions, and string methods are completed.

Edit the main.py file to create a program that does the following:

Take the input of a name for a triangle(1) along with its base(2) and height(3) measurement. Ouput the name of the triangle without vowels(A) (take out 'y' as well) along with the area(B) of the triangle. Ensure you take in the inputs and output the answer in that order.
